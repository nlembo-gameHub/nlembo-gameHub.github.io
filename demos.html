      <p>This is a collection of projects that I have worked on through my time at WakeTech and William Peace University. They are shorter projects with most of the art assets coming from the Epic Game or Unity Store with the main focus being the implementation of these assets, level design, game design, and programming. These are project demons that showcase skills I have with programming and blueprinting as well as any other features engines such as the Unreal Engine may have. I intend to expand this much further into the future with other projects I have or will work on, but for now I have decided to incorporate three I created at William Peace University for my Simulation and Game Tech II course. Blueprinting and Programming are done by me, but there are art and sound assets I did not create as my primary role is programming and level design. Credits for these assets can be found here:</p>
