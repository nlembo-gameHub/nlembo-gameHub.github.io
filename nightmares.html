      <p>Nightmares was a joint effort made by eight game design students during Wake Technical Community College's SGD Capstone, Summer 2020. I began this project as an A.I. programmer, but quickly became lead programmer and eventually Project Lead. The goal of the Capstone was to design and develop a game within a 10 week time period and then present a finished product before a live audience. This project was an amazing opportunity, and I got to experience working with a team. I was able to hone my skills in different areas as well as learn new ones; taking on roles and tasks beyond just programming. During the project, I got to use skills in organization, designing, implementing assets and features, and many other key elements needed to make a working game. Different fields such as Level Design, Gameplay Programming, A.I. programming, as well as cutscene and narrative programming and writing were all things I developed and implemented into the game.</p>
      <p>Working alongside the other programmers, I helped ensure that all different branches of player and world elements would interact with one another. I was also in-charge of the level design, sound implementation, art integration, documentation and organization of the team. This project allowed me to cooperate and organize a group with various skills and create a successful project that we were permitted to present.</p>
