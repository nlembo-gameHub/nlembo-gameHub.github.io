    <p>Nightmares was a joint effort made by myself and a group of fellow of students during Wake Technical Community College's SGD Capstone, Summer 2020. The goal of the capestone was to create a completed product within a 10 week time frame and presented it to a live audience. Through my role as project lead I got to work as the primary game designer, ensuring everything from code to animations made by different individuals worked and functioned alongside one another. I also worked on the documentation and organizational efforts of the game, leading several meetings as well as creating the documentation that allowed the team to work with efficiency. This project was an amazing opportunity for me as I learned and honed my skills in communication, collaborative skills, and gained experience with collaborative software and tools such as Github as well as coding standards.
